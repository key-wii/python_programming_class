# Run cannon.py in week13 to start the application! Make sure your terminal directory is in the week13 folder!

Features added:
1. Transformed the cannon into a moving tank by making it move horizontally
2. Developed various target types with different movement patterns by making targets that only moved horizontally, only moved vertically, and some that had a faster speed
3. Developed different projectile types: one that does not lose momentum when bouncing off surfaces, and one that is unaffected by gravity nor momentum loss
4. Added player 2 which moves using WASD and shoots with spacebar
5. Added bombs that targets drop down and disappear when hitting the floor
